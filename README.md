# tree-sitter grammar for CSS-in-JS.

## Releases

binaries for all supported OS/hardware platforms (all 1 of them) are automatically built for you.  Freshest copies of the shared libraries can be found in the `latest` release.

## Problem?

this doesn't build due to problems with tree-sitter-css using an external scanner.  see [#1808](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/1808).  help

update: this builds with the scanner taken from tree-sitter-css but that's not a great solution!
