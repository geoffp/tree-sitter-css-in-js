clone this repo into a directory where it'll be a sibling of `tree-sitter-css`.

```
[me@pc: ~/repos]$ ls
tree-sitter-css tree-sitter-css-in-js
```

this doesn't build due to problems with tree-sitter-css using an external scanner.  see [#1808](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/1808).  help
